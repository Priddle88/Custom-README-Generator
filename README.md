# Custom-README-Generator

A custom README created with Node!

## My name is Parker

To get better using node!

## Why

I want to use node to create a HTML file based off of the input from the user. This should save time in the long run when  I have to write future README's

Sometimes the layout for a README can be confusing and time consuming. This makes it way faster and easier.

## What I learned

I learned how to use Node to create a HTML file based off of user input
